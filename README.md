## Introduction
These files are supplement materials to the article, 'Effects of depressive symptoms, feelings, and interoception on reward-based decision making: Investigation using reinforcement learning model'.  
For more information, please see the original paper in "Brain Science".

## How to use
1. Conduct a reversal-learning task. Please open the file './reversal learning/reversal learning.psyexp' with psychopy2. For more information about this task, please refer to the paper.
2. Executing "rl_clean3.0.py" creates a dataset from the data obtained in step 1.
3. Executing "run_rl.R", you will start reinforcement learning modeling with the dataset obtained in step 2.
